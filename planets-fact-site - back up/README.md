## Overview

This is my 1st attempt at multi-page website. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

I initially started out by examining the detail in figma design file. i then discovered that the figma design gave the exact measurements for each element which was a great help. 

I started with the "mercury" desktop view 1st setting up all the HTML. 

I worked from top to bottom of the page.

I then added the styling with css. 1st mainly with absolute positioning but then later I included flex box with some of its properties which made things easier to place. 

Then i linked up my index.js file and linked up jQuery. 

After adding the behaviour of the buttons code i moved on to create the rest of the planet pages. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- jQuery

### What I learned

During this project i learned to work with SVG's. As before I have never seen an SVG. That took me abit of time to wrap my head around. I learned that stack overflow is a devs best friend as I have learned a ton from there. 

Next project I would like to work with Reactjs to make use of the components as I feel using those would have made this process alot quicker. 


### Continued development

I am continuing to sharpen my vanilla JS skills and want to build more JS projects. 
Reactjs is something I would like to make use of next.
Lastly I would like to improve my refactoring skills so my code can be cleaner and more readable for the next dev.
